    Version string suitable for putting into generated makefiles,
    changes less often than BAKEFILE_VERSION_FULL. The versions are usually
    identical, but they are not identical e.g. when using automatically
    generated snapshots whose version is changed to contain date, e.g.
    "0.1.1.20030719". BAKEFILE_VERSION does not contain the date part.
