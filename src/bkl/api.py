    Properties describe variables on targets etc. that are part of the API --
    that is, they have special meaning for the toolset and.
    Unlike free-form variables, properties have a type associated with them
    and any values assigned to them are checked for type correctness. They
    can optionally have a default value, too.

    .. attribute:: name

       Name of the property/variable.

    .. attribute:: type

       Type of the property, as :class:`bkl.vartypes.Type` instance.

    .. attribute:: default

       Default value of the property (as :class:`bkl.expr.Expr` or a function that returns
       an expression) or :const:`None`. If not specified (i.e. :const:`None`), then this
       property is required and must always be set to a value in the bakefile.

    .. attribute:: readonly

       Indicates if the property is read-only. Read-only properties can only
       have the default value and cannot be modified. They are typically
       derived from some other value and exist as a convenience. An example
       of read-only property is the ``id`` property on targets.

    .. attribute:: idempotent

       If a list property is idempotent, appending an element already existing
       in the list does nothing, instead of adding a second copy of it. This
       is useful for the list of the target dependencies, for example, as it's
       not useful to depend on something more than once.

    .. attribute:: scopes

       Optional scope of the property, as list of strings. Each item may be one
       of :const:`Property.SCOPE_PROJECT`, :const:`Property.SCOPE_MODULE`,
       :const:`Property.SCOPE_TARGET` for any target or target type name (e.g.
       ``program``) for scoping on specific target name.

       Finally, may be :const:`None` for default (depending from where the
       property was obtained from).

    .. attribute:: inheritable

       A property is *inheritable* if its value can be specified in the
       (grand-)parent scope. For example, an inheritable property on a target
       may be specified at the module level or even in the parent module; an
       inheritable property on a source file (e.g. "defines") may be specified
       on the target, the module and so on.

    .. attribute:: toolsets

       List of toolset names for toolsets this property applies to.
       This is mostly for documentation purposes, it doesn't affect
       their processing. Is :const:`None` for toolset-agnostic properties.

    .. attribute:: doc

       Optional documentation for the property.

    Example usage:

    .. code-block:: python
