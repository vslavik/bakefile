  This version of Bakefile is no longer actively developed, please use the
  current 1.x version from the 'master' branch instead.

 Running with Docker or Podman
-------------------------------

As an alternative to installing Bakefile on your system, you can use Docker
or Podman to run Bakefile in a container. The following command will run
Bakefile in a container and mount the current directory as a volume:

    docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workdir -w /workdir ghcr.io/vslavik/bakefile:0.2 bakefile

To run bakefile_gen, use the following command:

    docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workdir -w /workdir ghcr.io/vslavik/bakefile:0.2 bakefile_gen

If your bakefiles depend on files in parent directories, you can mount a larger
part of local filesystem, even your entire home directory, like this:

    docker run --rm -v $HOME:$HOME -w $(pwd) ghcr.io/vslavik/bakefile:0.2 bakefile_gen


 Requirements
--------------

Python >= 2.3.0 (last version tested is 2.6.4), including builtin XML modules.
It is highly recommended to install libxml2-python as well, but it is not
required.  (In Debian/Ubuntu, these are in python2.x, python2.x-dev,
python2.x-xmlbase and libxml2-python2.x packages.)


 Building Bakefile
-------------------

On Unix or in Unix-like environment, do ./configure && make && make install.
Requirements: installed Python (including headers).

On Windows, either download installer package or compile it by running
nmake -f makefile.vc. You will need Python installed in directory
specified at the beginning of makefile.vc and the same Visual C++ version that
was used to build Python (VC9 for 2.6, VC7 for 2.4 and 2.5, VC6 for 2.3).
Note that makefile.vc builds bakefile.exe and bakefile_gen.exe binaries that
work only if you have Python installed in the same directory where they are!


 Building from Subversion repository
-------------------------------------

(Note: this does _not_ apply to downloaded tarballs, only to code fetched
from SourceForge Subversion repository.)
Run bootstrap script and then proceed as when building from tarball. In order
to run bootstrap successfully, you need the following packages: SWIG 1.3.x
(http://www.swig.org), Automake >= 1.6, Autoconf >= 2.53, libtool, libxslt
(including xsltproc program) and DocBook XSL stylesheets (last two are needed
only to build HTML documentation).
On Windows, you need SWIG to build Bakefile from Subversion sources.
