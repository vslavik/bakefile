  1. Using Bakefile
=====================

If you obtained one of the prebuilt packages (MSI or ZIP file for windows or
the -bin.tar.bz2 tarball for Unix and OS X), then you can simply unpack it
somewhere and run the 'bkl' tool in its top directory.

On Windows, you don't need anything else, bkl.exe is self-contained executable.
On other systems, you must have Python (2.6 or newer) installed.

Also see the documentation in the docs/ subdirectory.



  2. Reporting bugs etc.
==========================

Source code repository, bug tracker, wiki:
https://github.com/vslavik/bakefile
https://github.com/vslavik/bakefile/issues

Mailing list for discussion of Bakefile issues:
bakefile-devel@lists.sourceforge.net



  3. Building from sources
============================

You'll need the following to compile Bakefile from sources obtained from
the git repository:

1. Python >= 2.6+

2. Sphinx documentation tool. Install it with

       easy_install Sphinx

3. If you want to run the test suite, you'll need py.test too:

       easy_install pytest

4. Some additional modules are used if available, but are not required:

       easy_install clint    (for colorized output)

If you are using a git checkout, then you just need to checkout the submodules:

       git submodule init
       git submodule update

Once all tools are installed, you can build Bakefile by running `make`. This
generates the parser from ANTLR grammar and build the HTML documentation.
