 Requirements
--------------

Python >= 2.3.0 (last version tested is 2.6.4), including builtin XML modules.
It is highly recommended to install libxml2-python as well, but it is not
required.  (In Debian/Ubuntu, these are in python2.x, python2.x-dev,
python2.x-xmlbase and libxml2-python2.x packages.)


 Building Bakefile
-------------------

On Unix or in Unix-like environment, do ./configure && make && make install.
Requirements: installed Python (including headers).

On Windows, either download installer package or compile it by running
nmake -f makefile.vc. You will need Python installed in directory
specified at the beginning of makefile.vc and the same Visual C++ version that
was used to build Python (VC9 for 2.6, VC7 for 2.4 and 2.5, VC6 for 2.3).
Note that makefile.vc builds bakefile.exe and bakefile_gen.exe binaries that
work only if you have Python installed in the same directory where they are!


 Building from Subversion repository
-------------------------------------

(Note: this does _not_ apply to downloaded tarballs, only to code fetched
from SourceForge Subversion repository.)
Run bootstrap script and then proceed as when building from tarball. In order
to run bootstrap successfully, you need the following packages: SWIG 1.3.x
(http://www.swig.org), Automake >= 1.6, Autoconf >= 2.53, libtool, libxslt
(including xsltproc program) and DocBook XSL stylesheets (last two are needed
only to build HTML documentation).
On Windows, you need SWIG to build Bakefile from Subversion sources.
