  Simple build type: only one option is used, which switches between debug and
  release builds.

  Usage: use template "simple" for your targets:

    <include file="presets/simple.bkl"/>
    <exe id="myapp" template="simple">
      <sources>myapp.cpp</sources>
    </exe>

-->

<makefile>

    <option name="DEBUG">
        <values>0,1</values>
        <default-value>0</default-value>
        <values-description>Release,Debug</values-description>
        <description>Set to 1 to build debug version</description>
    </option>

    <template id="simple">
        <define>
            $(substituteFromDict(DEBUG,{'1':'','0':'NDEBUG'}))
        </define>
        <optimize>
            $(substituteFromDict(DEBUG,{'1':'off','0':'speed'}))
        </optimize>
        <debug-info>
            $(substituteFromDict(DEBUG,{'1':'on','0':'off'}))
        </debug-info>
    </template>
